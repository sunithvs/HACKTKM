## Backend API Django
Setting up a Django project after cloning it from a repository involves a few key steps to ensure a smooth development environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Virtual Environment:**
   Create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. Navigate to the project folder in the terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate Virtual Environment:**
   Activate the virtual environment. On Windows, use:
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   On Unix/Linux/Mac, use:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Database Migration:**
   Apply initial database migrations to set up the database schema:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create Superuser (Optional):**
   If your project involves authentication, you may want to create a superuser for the Django admin:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Static Files:**
   Collect static files for serving (if applicable):
   ```bash
   python manage.py collect static
   ```



## How to Run
###  Running Django server
 1. **Run the Development Server:**
   Start the Django development server and check if everything is working:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Access the Application:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` or the specified address in the terminal to see your Django application.

### Running Flutter app
 1. **Start an emulator**
    
 2. **From the project root folder:**
    Run
    ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
